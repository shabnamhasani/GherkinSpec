GherkinSpec is a research-driven project that explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate regulatory provisions into Gherkin specifications. This approach aims to bridge the gap between complex legal texts and executable specifications, facilitating Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and enhancing compliance automation.
Gherkin specifications in our study were generated using the chat interfaces of Llama (via HuggingFace Chat: \url{https://huggingface.co/chat/}) and Claude (via \url{https://claude.ai/}). Consequently, we used the default model parameters.
